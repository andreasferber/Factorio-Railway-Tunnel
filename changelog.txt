Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2020-xx-xx
  Features:
    - Initial Release.
    - Trains just work with tunnels, pathing through them. Set up a trains schedule to go to a point on the other side of a tunnel and it will be used automatically.
    - Buildable tunnel parts; portals (entrance/exit), underground segments and special tracks to cross underground segments. Regular and track crossing underground segments can be fast replaced.
    - Tunnel parts can be mined and destroyed. Mining is blocked while a tunnel is in use. Destroying a tunnel part kills any train carriages in it.
    - Unlimited tunnels on a map in horizontal and vertical orientations supported.
    - Tunnel underground segments can be driven and walked over, but not built on.
    - Temporary graphics and icons that work from the editor (unsorted category).
